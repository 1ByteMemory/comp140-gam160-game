# Previous Ideas

## Cannon Defence - Dan Jones

Cannon Defence is a game where the player defends the castle from waves of invaders. The invaders are attempting to kidnap the people of the castle. The aim of the game is to see how long you can last before everyone has been kidnapped.

**Core Mechanics**
#### Operating the cannon

1. The player loads the the cannon useing a _"Rammer"_. 
2. Next the player positions the cannon rotating it left/right and up/down.
3. Finally the player fires the cannon.

------

#### Win/Defeat Condition
The game is wave based, each wave is complete when all enamies have been defeated. The player is defeated when all villagers have been kidnapped or are dead.


------

#### Aditional Mechanics

The player may choose from a veriaty of cannon balls each with different properties.
Each round the player is has a set amount of ammo and different cannon balls use different amounts. 

Type | Name | Properties | Ammo Needed
--- | --- | --- | ---
AOE | Standard | High Damage, Low Impact Raduis | 0
AOE | Explosive | High Damage, High Impact Raduis, High Push Force | 10
AOE | Freeze | Low Damage, Large Impact Raduis, Freezes | 10
AOE | Poison | Low Damage over time, Meduim Impact Raduis | 5
Direct Hit | Snipe | Fast Travel time, hold ten shots before needing to reload, High Damage | 5
Direct Hit | Scatter | Lots of small balls cover wide area, Meduim Damage | 5
Direct Hit | Infection | Enemy turns on its allies infecting others, short life span | 10
Magic | Lightning | Summons Lightning On every enemy dealing Very High Damage | 30
Magic | Deaths Howl | Causes all enamies to cowering in fear for several seconds | 20

When an invader kidnaps a someone, they run back to the forrest. The player has a chance to kill the invader and the villager has a chance to run back to the castle. They will be two options that can make the game harder.
1. Friendly Fire - All cannon balls and magic will have the same effects on the Villager.
2. Not Safe Yet - Invaders can pick up Villagers that are running back to the castle.

## Backup Idea

### Flappy Human

Flappy Human is a silly game where the player weres a pair of wings and flaps their arms to fly around.

With this base idea I can have different gamemodes to choose from for example, flying through rings, cearfully flying through a deadly forrest dodging predators or hunting prey, or the classic flappy bird clone.
