When an invader kidnaps a someone, they run back to the forrest. The player has a chance to kill the invader and the villager has a chance to run back to the castle. They will be two options that can make the game harder.
1. Friendly Fire - All cannon balls and magic will have the same effects on the Villager.
2. Not Safe Yet - Invaders can pick up Villagers that are running back to the castle.
